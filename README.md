 SaaS Customer Churn Analysis (Telco Dataset)
Hey! I’m Christelle, and this is a project I put together to dig into customer churn — specifically, what makes people cancel a subscription and what businesses can do about it.

I used a Telco customer dataset (which closely mirrors a SaaS model) and ran some analysis using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn — all inside Google Colab.

I’ve worked in Sales Engineering and Data roles before, so this project blends two things I really enjoy: data storytelling and helping businesses understand their users better.

What this project looks at:
How many customers are churning

What types of contracts lead to higher churn

Whether higher monthly charges are tied to people leaving

What I found:
About 27% of customers churned

Customers with month-to-month contracts churn way more than those on long-term contracts

People with higher monthly bills were more likely to churn — makes sense if they’re not seeing the value

If I were presenting this to a business, I’d recommend:
Offering discounts or incentives to get customers on annual plans

Giving high-paying customers more support (they might expect more)

Paying attention to new users in their first month — a lot of them dropped off early

Tools I used:
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Google Colab for everything (no local setup!)

Cleaned + analyzed over 7,000 customer records

Why I did this:
I’m rebuilding my technical portfolio and wanted to create something that’s both data-driven and business-minded — just like the work I enjoy doing in Sales Engineering. I’ll be adding more like this soon!

Thanks for reading!
If you’re working on churn problems or want to talk about data + SaaS stuff, I’d love to connect.
